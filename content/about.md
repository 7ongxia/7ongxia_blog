- 👋 Hi, I’m Jong Kim

I've been working as a backend developer and a cloud engineer for few years. 
I also have journals full of random thoughts which are mostly in Korean.
In my free time, I enjoy running, playing my bass guitar and learning new topics.

I am practicing English by writing on this blog, so please support me even if my writing is a bit awkward! 🙏

😗 😙 😚
